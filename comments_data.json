New Lantern is building an AI copilot for radiologists to automate this non-diagnostic work, so radiologists can focus on what they do best: caring for patients and interpreting images.We are starting to find product-market fit and recently raised a $19M Series A from Benchmark [2]. Demand for our product is growing, and we're hiring software engineers in San Francisco to help us scale our product and our team. We work together in person five days a week from our office in Jackson Square.Engineering is at the heart of New Lantern. Our engineers work directly with our founder/CEO, our staff radiologist, and our end users to build features that radiologists rely on daily. Everyone has real ownership and autonomy, moves quickly, and ships meaningful work frequently. We're a small, sharp team of frontend, full-stack, and backend engineers building a React-based web app backed by Python services, cloud infrastructure, and LLMs.I'm Steve, New Lantern's Head of Engineering. If you're interested or want to learn more, shoot me a note at (my HN username)@newlantern.ai.[1] We translate \"AI copilot\" to \"AI radiology resident\" when we speak with medical professionals, but the former is the clearest way to communicate what we're building here.[2]https://newlantern.ai/blog/new-lantern-19m-series-a-led-by-b...",

Our interest rates are less than 1/3 of the rates our customers are able to get from other financing options.We are a VC backed company and have been in business for 6 years. We have been profitable for the past year and with a new debt facility closing at the end of June, we will be dramatically ramping up origination volume in the second half of the year. We are hiring an additional backend engineer to support the larger transaction volume, as well as to support new products we plan to launch to diversify our revenue stream. You will join our engineering team of 10 and work in a dynamic environment where you are frequently writing net new code to support business objectives.Our tech stack for the back-end is fully on AWS, using Lambda and ECS for compute and Typescript as the language, but experience with this specific stack is not necessary for talented candidates.
