New Lantern is building an AI copilot for radiologists to automate this non-diagnostic work, so radiologists can focus on what they do best: caring for patients and interpreting images.\n\nWe are starting to find product-market fit and recently raised a $19M Series A from Benchmark [2]. Demand for our product is growing, and we're hiring software engineers in San Francisco to help us scale our product and our team. We work together in person five days a week from our office in Jackson Square.\n\nEngineering is at the heart of New Lantern. Our engineers work directly with our founder/CEO, our staff radiologist, and our end users to build features that radiologists rely on daily. Everyone has real ownership and autonomy, moves quickly, and ships meaningful work frequently. We're a small, sharp team of frontend, full-stack, and backend engineers building a React-based web app backed by Python services, cloud infrastructure, and LLMs.\n\nI'm Steve, New Lantern's Head of Engineering. If you're interested or want to learn more, shoot me a note at (my HN username)@newlantern.ai.\n\n[1] We translate \"AI copilot\" to \"AI radiology resident\" when we speak with medical professionals, but the former is the clearest way to communicate what we're building here.\n\n[2]\n\nhttps://newlantern.ai/blog/new-lantern-19m-series-a-led-by-b...",

For too long, medical software has been clunky, user-hostile and complicated, and we are changing that. Several customers have independently described us as \u2019the Apple of practice management software\u2019.\n\nWe are a bootstrapped, profitable and remote-first company of 30 people with 6 full stack engineers including the company\u2019s founder, Dominic. Having been remote from day 1, we fully believe in its benefits. We do have a lovely office in London by the river for in-person collaboration when required, but this is not mandatory as we know some like in-person working and some prefer fully remote!\n\nAbout you\n\nWe\u2019re looking for a Senior Support Engineer to work with our Support and Data Migration teams for day to day work troubleshooting and resolving technical customer issues. We\u2019re specifically after someone who is curious, experienced and enjoys investigating and solving technical issues that vary from fixing simple bugs to small tweaks to existing features (e.g. adding a new column to a CSV export) to writing Ruby scripts to execute changes after a data migration to Carebit.\n\nYou\u2019ll likely have a strong software development background already. This is a hands-on role where you\u2019ll be regularly shipping fixes and improvements to the core Carebit platform as well.\n\n- Strong experience with Ruby on Rails and React, especially design patterns (we use Rails 7 and Ruby 3.4 with Postgres 17, deployed to AWS ECS)\n- Bonus points for Linux/sysadmin and Postgres knowledge\n- Fluent in written and verbal English and an excellent, timely communicator - especially with customers\n- Self-disciplined, autonomous, motivated, and able to manage concurrent tasks\n\nThis is a fully remote role but we operate on London, UK time and so are only considering candidates in GMT/BST \u00b13 time zones who are willing to work to UK hours (typically 9am-5.30pm)\n\nPlease email CVs to hiring[[at]]carebit dot co if you\u2019re interested in learning more!",

We're obsessed with computers, programming, big data, databases, compilers, hardware, math, data science, and the internet. Does this sound like you? Please apply to join our team.\n\nOur code base is very friendly to new contributors. You'll have a fully-functional development environment within hours (fully automated) and be pushing commits on your first day. Deployments to production happen multiple times per day and finish in less than 2 minutes. Effectively all of our codebase is written in Python, Rust, SQL, Javascript/TypeScript, and Nix. The core technologies you'll need familiarity with to be productive are Python, PostgreSQL, Linux, and Git.\n\nWe operate at a larger scale than typical startups. We operate two datacenters with high performance servers we've built that are capable of dealing with the volumes of data we process. We've implemented our own distributed file system. We do full-scale web crawls. We download and perform static analysis on the entire universe of Android APKs and iOS IPAs that are published. Unlike a typical startup where you'll spend half of your time in meetings, and the other half fixing bugs from Jira tickets\u2014 at MixRank you'll get to challenge yourself with difficult technical problems that will help you to grow as an individual.\n\nWe're hiring continuously for the positions below\u2014 they aren't singular positions that will close once filled. Our philosophy on hiring is that the candidate is more important than the position. For each new member of the team, we design a custom role and responsibilities that are specialized to their interests. Other companies will come up with a long list of specific requirements for a position with the expectation that you'll exactly replace someone from the team, or that you'll be the perfect tetris piece that satisfies the job requirements decided by a committee. MixRank is more pragmatic: we'll first get excited about having a unique individual on the team, then we'll figure out the best way to accommodate their specific talents.\n\n--\n\nJunior Software Engineer - Remote (Global), Full-Time\n\nWe're looking for remote junior engineers that have 0-3 years of professional experience in software, and 5+ years of curiosity exploring computers, programming, and technical hobby projects. This is an open-ended entry role with mentorship and diverse opportunities to work on all areas of our product: databases, distributed systems, infrastructure and tooling, data analysis, machine learning, frontend/backend web development, APIs, data mining, data modeling, and more. To stand out, please highlight what makes you unique: passion for computing, curiosity and side projects, work ethic, niche research, etc.\n\nIdeally you've already graduated, but if you still have one or more years left of school, please feel free to apply anyway, and if you're the right fit for the team we'll figure out a way to accommodate your schedule.\n\nhttps://www.ycombinator.com/companies/mixrank/jobs/Fnwsojk-j...\n\n--\n\nSoftware Engineer - Remote (Global), Full-Time\n\nWe're hiring generalist software engineers to work on web applications, data mining, machine learning/data science, data transformation/ETL, data modeling, database scaling, infrastructure, devops, and more. We'll cater the role to whatever subset of these areas match your interests.\n\nBeneficial experience includes PostgreSQL, Python, Rust, Linux, TypeScript, Nix, frontend/backend web development, and data mining.\n\nhttps://www.ycombinator.com/companies/mixrank/jobs/RXQspen-s...\n\n--\n\nI'm Scott, Founder/CEO/CTO. We're based in US but applicants from Central America, South America, Europe, Asia, and Africa are encouraged!",
